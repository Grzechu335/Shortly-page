## About the App
The Shortly page is a web application designed to take long URLs provided by the user and generate shortened versions. When a user submits a URL, the application sends a request to the address https://cutt.ly. The response from https://cutt.ly contains a shortened link. However, since this is the free version, there is a restriction of 3 requests per minute. If the user exceeds this limit, they will receive a notification informing them about the restriction.
